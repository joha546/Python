Python can manipulate text (represented by type str, so-called “strings”) as well as numbers. This includes characters “!”, words “rabbit”, 
names “Paris”, sentences “Got your back.”, etc. “Yay! :)”. They can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the
same result
'''

name = 'Paris'
double_quotes= "Paris rabbit got your back :)! Yay!"

print(name)
print(double_quotes)
print(s)
